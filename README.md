# ComputerOrganization

Assignments for one of the courses of University of Toronto (UofT). I used starter codes, provided by course instructors, as well as my code to finish them.  

-- everything written in verilog  
-- codes for labs are works with circuits, registers, counters, FMS, muxes, adders etc  
-- codes are low level hardware codes  
-- final project is a game called 'egg catcher'  
-- the aim is with a bucket on the bottom of the screen to catch an egg, generated in a random position on the top. Egss are falling with different speeds. If you fail to catch a single egg the game will restart.  
-- to run the game you need an IDE
